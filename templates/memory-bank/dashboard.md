### **For Fresh Memory Reset**
1. **Start Here**: Read this dashboard for current status
2. **Get Context**: Review [[activeContext]] for immediate priorities
3. **Understand Scope**: Check [[projectbrief]] for project boundaries
4. **Check Progress**: Review [[progress]] for recent accomplishments
5. **Deep Dive**: Read relevant technical docs ([[systemPatterns]], [[techContext]])

### **For Specific Workstreams**

### **Advanced Analytics**
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
  "üìä " + file.name as "Canvas",
  "üéØ " + choice(contains(file.name, "system"), "Architecture Overview", choice(contains(file.name, "feature"), "Development Workflow", "Problem Solving")) as "Purpose",
  "üîó [Open Canvas](" + file.path + ")" as "Access"
FROM "projects/{PROJECT_NAME}/canvas"
WHERE file.extension = "canvas"
SORT file.name ASC
```
