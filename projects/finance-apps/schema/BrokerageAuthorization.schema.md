# BrokerageAuthorization (Schema)

Canonical YAML fragment (extracted from API):

```yaml
BrokerageAuthorization:
  description: |
    A single connection with a brokerage. Note that `Connection` and `Brokerage Authorization` are interchangeable, but the term `Connection` is preferred and used in the doc for consistency.
```
