# Active Development Context - Markbot Command Center Implementation

## 🚨 **CRITICAL PRIORITY: Domain Model Architecture Refactor**

**Status**: Analysis Complete | **Priority**: Critical | **Workstream**: Infrastructure

### **Problem Identified**
Comprehensive analysis reveals our domain models are scattered across **3 incompatible layers**:
- **40+ Python Pydantic models** (complete SnapTrade API coverage)
- **2 SQLAlchemy ORM models** (95% of entities missing from cache)
- **6 TypeScript interfaces** (manual sync, field mismatches)

**Impact**: Performance degradation, development friction, scalability concerns

### **Solution Strategy**
**Unified Architecture Approach**:
1. **Schema-First Design**: Single YAML source of truth for all 40+ entities
2. **Intelligent Cache Layer**: SQLite with TTL, smart sync, and batch operations
3. **Code Generation Pipeline**: Auto-generate TypeScript, SQLAlchemy, and API models
4. **Migration Strategy**: Gradual rollout with fallback mechanisms

**Expected Benefits**: 10x performance improvement, eliminated manual sync, enterprise scalability

## Current Status: August 13, 2025 - Advanced Trading Platform Operations

### 🎯 **LATEST ACHIEVEMENT: Advanced Performance Metrics & UX Enhancement Complete**

We have successfully implemented advanced trading performance metrics (Sortino and Calmar ratios) across the entire system, enhanced trading data with user-friendly ticker displays, and significantly improved the Command Center interface with structured result formatting. The platform now provides institutional-grade performance analysis with superior user experience.

### 🎯 **PREVIOUS ACHIEVEMENT: Markbot Command Center Web Interface Complete**

We have successfully created a comprehensive web-based control panel that brings all CLI trading operations to an intuitive web interface. The **Markbot Command Center** provides unified access to all trading bot functionality through an elegant, organized dashboard.

### 🎯 **PREVIOUS MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT: Markbot Command Center Complete**

We have successfully created a comprehensive web-based interface that brings all CLI commands to the web in a creative and user-friendly way. The **Markbot Command Center** provides a unified control panel for executing trading bot commands, running backtests, and managing the system through an intuitive web interface.

### 🎯 **Previous Achievement: SpendViz-Markbot Integration Complete**

We have successfully resolved the complex routing and data integration issues between [[spendviz]] frontend and [[markbot]] backend. The full integration pipeline is now functional: **SpendViz Frontend → SpendViz Backend Proxy → Markbot API → SnapTrade API**. Users can now view live trading data in the SpendViz web interface.

### 🎯 **Previous Achievement: Professional Trading Platform with Intelligent Optimization Complete**

We have successfully transformed Markbot into a professional-grade algorithmic trading platform with comprehensive CLI restructuring, enhanced strategy parameter support, critical bug fixes, and intelligent Optuna-powered optimization. The system now provides enterprise-level trading capabilities with an intuitive user interface.

### ✅ **LATEST Key Accomplishments - Advanced Metrics & UX Enhancement**

   * **Market Data**: Get Quote (with symbol/account inputs), Search Symbols, View Accounts
   * **Portfolio Management**: Summary, Positions, Orders, Activities  
   * **Backtesting & Optimization**: Run Backtest, Compare All Strategies, Optimize Strategy

3. **🗂️ Navigation & Routing**:
   * **New route**: `/markbot/command-center` accessible via App.tsx routing
   * **Sidebar integration**: New "Command Center" navigation item with control panel icon
   * **Dashboard integration**: Prominent Command Center link card on main dashboard

4. **📋 Dashboard Cleanup (As Requested)**:
   * **Removed Strategy Performance section** from main dashboard
   * **Moved Data Population functionality** to Command Center admin section
   * **Added attractive Command Center navigation card** with gradient styling

5. **🔌 Backend API Expansion**:
   * **Added missing proxy routes**: `/connections`, `/activities`, `/search`
   * **Portfolio management endpoints**: `/portfolio/backtest`, `/portfolio/compare-strategies`, `/portfolio/optimize`
   * **Complete CLI-to-API mapping**: All CLI commands now accessible via web interface

### 🎯 **Command Center Features Implemented**
