# Active Development Context - Markbot Command Center Implementation

## Current Status: August 13, 2025 - Advanced Trading Platform Operations

### 🎯 **LATEST ACHIEVEMENT: Advanced Performance Metrics & UX Enhancement Complete**

We have successfully implemented advanced trading performance metrics (Sortino and Calmar ratios) across the entire system, enhanced trading data with user-friendly ticker displays, and significantly improved the Command Center interface with structured result formatting. The platform now provides institutional-grade performance analysis with superior user experience.

### 🎯 **PREVIOUS ACHIEVEMENT: Markbot Command Center Web Interface Complete**

We have successfully created a comprehensive web-based control panel that brings all CLI trading operations to an intuitive web interface. The **Markbot Command Center** provides unified access to all trading bot functionality through an elegant, organized dashboard.

### 🎯 **PREVIOUS MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT: Markbot Command Center Complete**

We have successfully created a comprehensive web-based interface that brings all CLI commands to the web in a creative and user-friendly way. The **Markbot Command Center** provides a unified control panel for executing trading bot commands, running backtests, and managing the system through an intuitive web interface.

### 🎯 **Previous Achievement: SpendViz-Markbot Integration Complete**

We have successfully resolved the complex routing and data integration issues between [[spendviz]] frontend and [[markbot]] backend. The full integration pipeline is now functional: **SpendViz Frontend → SpendViz Backend Proxy → Markbot API → SnapTrade API**. Users can now view live trading data in the SpendViz web interface.

### 🎯 **Previous Achievement: Professional Trading Platform with Intelligent Optimization Complete**

We have successfully transformed Markbot into a professional-grade algorithmic trading platform with comprehensive CLI restructuring, enhanced strategy parameter support, critical bug fixes, and intelligent Optuna-powered optimization. The system now provides enterprise-level trading capabilities with an intuitive user interface.
