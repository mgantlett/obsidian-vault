- [x] Enhanced frontmatter schema for all memory bank files
- [x] Task extraction and Obsidian task format conversion
- [x] Main project dashboard creation
- [x] Optimized local custom-instructions
- [x] Core workflow templates (feature-development, bug-investigation)

### 🎨 **Phase 2A: Visual Management (COMPLETE)**
- [x] System architecture Canvas - Interactive system overview
- [x] Strategy development Canvas - Complete development workflow
- [x] Issue resolution Canvas - Systematic problem-solving process
- [x] Enhanced dashboard with Canvas integration
- [x] Advanced Dataview queries with Canvas links

### 🌟 **Phase 2B: Universal Template & Multi-Project Structure (COMPLETE)**
- [x] Universal workflow template structure created
- [x] Generic custom-instructions template
- [x] Setup and requirements documentation
- [x] Multi-project vault structure implemented
- [x] Project-organized file hierarchy

### 🚀 **Phase 3: Native Obsidian Optimization (PLANNED)**

#### **Simplified Memory Bank System**
- [ ] **Reduce Complexity**: From 7 files to 3-4 native Obsidian approach
- [ ] **Single Project File**: Comprehensive project overview with sections instead of separate files
- [ ] **Dynamic Dashboards**: Generate dashboards from single project file metadata
- [ ] **Native Task Integration**: Use Obsidian's task management instead of custom tracking

#### **Smart Template System**
- [ ] **Auto-detection**: Automatically detect project type and customize templates
- [ ] **One-Command Setup**: Zero manual customization required
- [ ] **Intelligent Context**: Context-aware content generation based on project type
- [ ] **Template Validation**: Automated verification of setup completeness

#### **Advanced Canvas Integration**
- [ ] **Self-Updating Maps**: Canvas files that update based on project changes
- [ ] **Dynamic Relationships**: Visual connections that reflect actual code relationships
- [ ] **Interactive Elements**: Clickable Canvas elements linked to code and documentation
- [ ] **Template Canvas**: Reusable Canvas patterns for different project types

#### **Performance & Polish**
- [ ] **Dataview Optimization**: Faster queries and better caching
- [ ] **Graph Enhancement**: Improved graph view for project relationships
- [ ] **Plugin Integration**: Custom plugins for workflow automation
- [ ] **Mobile Support**: Optimized workflow for mobile Obsidian use

## 📊 **Progress Tracking**

```dataview
TASK
FROM "projects/obsidian-workflow-enhancement"
WHERE !completed
SORT priority DESC
```

### **Completed Tasks**
```dataview
TASK
FROM "projects/obsidian-workflow-enhancement"
WHERE completed
SORT completion DESC
```

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

### **Immediate Benefits (Phase 1)**
- ⚡ **50% faster context switching** through dashboards
- 📋 **Zero manual progress tracking** via automation
- 🎯 **Standardized workflows** through templates
- 🔗 **Seamless local-to-Obsidian integration**

### **Long-term Value (Phase 3)**
- 📊 **Visual project understanding** via Canvas
- 🧠 **Enhanced memory reset recovery**
- 📈 **Scalable task management**
- 🔍 **Knowledge graph navigation**

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Enhanced Frontmatter Schema**
```yaml
---
tags: [memory-bank, core, active-context]
project: finance-apps
type: active-context
status: current | completed | planned | blocked
priority: critical | high | medium | low
workstream: backend | frontend | integration | optimization
created: 2025-08-13
last-updated: 2025-08-13
last-action: 2025-08-13
next-milestone: description
managed-by: obsidian-mcp
---
```

### **Dataview Queries**

#### **Active Tasks Dashboard**
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
  file.link as "File",
  status as "Status",
  priority as "Priority",
  workstream as "Workstream",
  next-milestone as "Next Milestone"
FROM "cline-memory-banks/finance-apps"
WHERE status != "completed"
SORT priority DESC, last-updated DESC
```

#### **Recent Activity**
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
  file.link as "File",
  last-action as "Last Action",
  last-updated as "Updated"
FROM "cline-memory-banks/finance-apps"
SORT last-updated DESC
LIMIT 5
```

## 🎨 **Canvas Layouts**

### **System Architecture Canvas**
Visual representation of:
- markbot ↔ spendviz integration
- SnapTrade API connections
- Database relationships
- Service layer interactions

### **Strategy Development Canvas**
Workflow visualization:
- Strategy conception → Implementation → Backtesting → Optimization → Deployment

### **Issue Resolution Canvas**
Debugging workflow:
- Problem identification → Root cause analysis → Solution implementation → Verification
